## What is Genius Lyrics Bot?
This bot is using Genius Public API to get the song's lyrics. This service is free to use and very basic to use.
### What about permissions that Genius Lyrics Bot is using on My Discord Server?
**Genius Lyrics BOT** _DOESN'T NEED ANY PERMISSONS._

It's like a normal user of your server. It needs only read and send messages permissions like a normal user. 
It also using Slash Commands! It means you and your users in the server can easly use the bot.

## Commands
# /lyrics [song]
  This is the main command of the bot. It provides you the lyrics of the song you want.
  
  (Some songs lyrics are too long for discord messages. The limit of the message character on discord is 4096. You will get the link of genius page of the song if it is reaching the character limit.)
